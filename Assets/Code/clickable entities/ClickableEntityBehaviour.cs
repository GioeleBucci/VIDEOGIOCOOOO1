    /// - All MonoBehaviour objects have an "OnMouseDown()" method. This is available only if the
    /// object has a "Collider" attached from the editor as a component.
    /// - OnMouseDown() acts as a Raycast, which detects the first object it hits; in our case, it
    /// was the sight radius of the guard and not the guard itself, this is why I couldn't click the guard.
    /// - However, if an object in the hierarchy has a "RigidBody" component, the Raycast will ignore other
    /// children objects and only consider the one with the "RigidBody" component.
    /// 
    /// Other interesting matters:
    /// - scripts that don't need a GameObject can inherit from ScriptableObject.
